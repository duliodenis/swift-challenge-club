# Swift Fight Club
Welcome to the Swift Fight Club. This is where I post code solutions to the SCC.

But remember - the first rule of Swift Fight Club is you have to do it on your own first before you look at the solution. Even if it takes you hours. Only look at the solution once you have working code that passes the tests.
